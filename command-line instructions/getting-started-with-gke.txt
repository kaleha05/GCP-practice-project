Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

-Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

-Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

1.Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster
-In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.
-For convenience, place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE. At the Cloud Shell prompt, type this command
	export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
-Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:
	gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
-After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:
	kubectl version

2.Run and deploy a container
-From your Cloud Shell prompt, launch a single instance of the nginx container.
	kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
-View the pod running the nginx container:
	kubectl get pods
-Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
	kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
-View the new service:
	kubectl get services
-Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.
-Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
	kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
-Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
	kubectl get pods
-Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
	kubectl get services
